# HOW IT WORKS
I enjoy Tech's essay, and I want to read more, so I start to collect interesting blogs and the result is this list.

However, there are always too much content. Sources like TechCrunch generated hundreds of articles within a few days, and obviously not every one of them worth my time.

So how can I read the more interesting ones, given my limited time?

So I started to try to use some data to filter the feed. I first experimented with Facebook and Twitter's sharing data, but the result is not very good. Then I tried Pocket. And it turned out to be pretty good, so the result is TechBlog.
